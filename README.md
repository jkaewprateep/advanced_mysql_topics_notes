## 🧸💬 Database table select and union

🧸💬 Database ```selection filter``` is the beginning of the process to find out possibilities for data population in reports and evaluation methods, the next process of ```filtering```, ```aggregation```, ```remarking```, ```transforming```, and ```making use``` of the populated data will be easier with correct preferred formats. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ In basic report tools, they separate ```details area```, ```aggregation area```, and ```asides area``` and this concept helps with data population and dataset organization. </br>

🐣💬 ```SAP!!!``` ```ERP!!!``` 🧸💬 ```Template report``` and ```business report``` they are commercials name. 👤💬 ```Jasper``` 👤💬 ```Avaya Cognos``` 👤💬‼️ ```IBM``` 👤💬 ```Google Visulaization``` ... </br>

🦭💬 They support ```data adaptors``` and ```dataset visualization tools``` but ```manual query import``` and ```procedure are possible```, implementation with procedure the programmers need to ```seal of application method with online modification ability```. </br>
👤💬 All applications are ```encapsulated with power data adaptors``` and ```secured application settings``` for dataset communication string and import / export tools. </br>

🐑💬 ➰ In project challenges ```copied of dataset``` or ```application settings``` is ```prohibited``` and they are seal with application secured communication protocols when somebody try to copied of the dataset except from report dataset using at client they cannot read or they can connect with custom connection string. </br>
🦭💬 For DotNet application there is ```encrypted connection string``` and ```application settings``` option for Java and SQL they use ```data integration services``` and ```data integration services``` report you need to open on the same server or application allowed in the solution. </br>

## 🧸💬 Database table group by and aggregate function

🐐💬 Aggregation function had dedicated right from detail population in some report because of controls of data populate is at ```client level``` and ```server level``` once query, some users ```attached results``` from ```aggregation function``` and ```store procedure``` without validation in the detail area. </br> 
</br> 
👧💬 🎈 There is a ```tricks for this aggregation``` because of group by method need to access for all of data population for the target column fields, this is select ```hacks in MySQL``` and it is ```not actually hacking``` but it is selection method for working with data field and ```called by some users``` . </br>
👧💬 🎈 At the line ```GROUP BY YEAR(A.Date), CONVERT(YEAR(Date), CHAR)) AS C``` is where memory populate of data will populate into the column ``` CONCAT(C.Cost, " (", C.Year, " ) ") AS "Total sum of P2 Product" ``` .</br>
👧💬 🎈 At the line ```CONVERT(SUM(A.Cost), CHAR) AS "Cost", CONVERT(YEAR(B.Date), CHAR) AS "Year"``` is the actual value, you can use INNER join to prevent of create ```NULL``` values population. </br>

## 🧸💬 Database table join

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 There are multiple types of ```systems and report evaluation```, ```internal system reports```, ```interactions and contact```, ```application reports```, ```user and agent statistics```, ```initiator networks reports```, ```prediction reports```, and ```surveys```. The databases and data tables relationships are designed for ```various types of database constraints``` and the first step is to select the existing report and ```find the report categorize``` the events or statistics created at which level of the report because of interaction contact report initial at ```gateway and application report``` can start at users. This method works in many databases and is used in data validation for system integration reports between 2 or among solutions. </br> 
</br> 
🦭💬 That is a trick when validating the results set someone missing this step may have a number of data populations in the same list number but not in order. ```🥺💬 ผมตรวจคำตอบจริงจริงนะ``` </br>
</br> 
🦤💬 There is a technique of ```dividing table resultset``` for ```delays messages communications```, data set can be joined with ```temporary table views``` or ```temporary table``` by the database temporary and populate of data with detail after they arrived. Someone may use stored procedure, data adaptors ability or results set from LINQ, or data mapping. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ The ```statistics server manages of statistics data in memory in the same way as the data tables does```, this is for information debugging and communication with the same expectation. All methods are build permanent and encapsulated solution for the project achievements. </br>

## 🧸💬 Database table temporary table view

🐨🎁🎵🎶 ```Important when working with the View temporary table, all of the outcomes of the data to the population in the view table resultset should arrive at the same time because the final result with store and ready once all fields are fulfilled with data from selection criteria are some methods for delays messages communication and data population we had discussed``` . </br>
</br>
🐐💬 By ```database schemas```, ```user and group permission assignment```, ```application ability by permissions``` grants from database solution can protect users from finding tables and working on the existing data and creating programs. Someone assigned ```domain policy``` to create ```local caches file``` or resultset cache files for some application you need to use ```stored procedure``` in the report applications.  ```🥺💬 แน่ะ แน่ะ รู้นะ```</br>

## 🧸💬 Database table indexes

🧸💬 This had tricks known from a famous application about ```reversed column order sorting``` . </br>
👧💬 🎈 In a famous application of name and data fields as string sorting, reverse order, and data column substring can index and ```boost database query performance``` . ```Stored procedure``` import and update help about ```communications delay message``` when update results from client and sometimes ```application IDE``` help because they had ```internal objects Queue management``` .</br>

## 🧸💬 Database function

🧸💬 This had tricks for column minar or worksheet columns organization, in some applications dataset and resultset display is easier than selection </br>
